# GPT4All Python

## Installation

To get started, pip-install the `gpt4all` package into your python environment.

```bash
pip install gpt4all
```

We recommend installing `gpt4all` into its own virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`

## Downloading models

Models are automatically saved to your computer when you load them with the GPT4All python client:

```python
from gpt4all import GPT4All

 # download new model or load existing model
model = GPT4All("orca-mini-3b-gguf2-q4_0.gguf")
```
